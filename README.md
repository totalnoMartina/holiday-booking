# Holiday Booking Webiste - Holiday Home

This webpage is made for a privately owned house that rents out apartments to guests for summer holidays on the coastal side of Croatia. As clients have been using [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) for the past years, there has been some overlapping of bookings which were not easy to handle by the host. Through this website users can get into direct contact with the owner of the house and set up details of the booking process via email.
